    These are some definition of aspects:
     - creativity : How unlikely is the question to be asked? Is it challenging the assistant with a problem that requires creative thinking? Does the question include lots of context? On the assistant's side, is the reply straightforward, or does it contain a unique approach to a problem?
     - humor : Contains humorous content including sarcasm
     - violence : Encourages or fails to discourage violence/abuse/terrorism/self-harm
     - hate speech : content is abusive or threatening and expresses prejudice against a protected characteristic. Prejudice refers to preconceived views not based on reason. Protected characteristics include gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and similar characteristics.
     - not appropriate : Inappropriate for a customer assistant.
     - fails task : Fails to follow the correct instruction / task
     - spam : We consider the following unwanted content as spam: trolling, intentional undermining of our purpose, illegal material, material that violates our code of conduct, and other things that are inappropriate for our dataset. We collect these under the common heading of "spam".
